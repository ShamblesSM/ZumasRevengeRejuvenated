	The minimum (leftmost) pan value is -10,000. The maximum (rightmost) is 10,000. 

	You can specify a default directory to load sounds from with the "dir" parameter.

	The parameters "mintime" and "maxtime" control the min/max time range
	for choosing a random sound to play. They are in seconds and can be fractional. 
	
	The "volume" parameter is between 0.0 and 1.0. This is the default volume all sounds play at.

	Define a new soundscape with the "Soundscape" tag. Give it a unique ID. You will use this in the level XML
	to indicate which soundscape to use.

		<!-- By default, the sound will play at a random pan value between panmin and panmax.
			You can force it to play at a specific pan value by using the parameter pan="<some value>".
			This will, just for this sample, override any default settings.
			
			The "file" parameter is the name of the file to load. DO NOT PRECEED IT WITH A SLASH.
			This file will be presumed to be in the directory indicated by the default directory
			(or Soundscape directory if you overrode it there).
			
			The "volume" parameter is between 0 and 1.0 (1 is default) and indicates how loud the sound is.
			This will, just for this sample, override any default settings.
			
			"randomweight" indicates what weight to give the sound. A higher weight relative to other sounds
			in the soundscape means that it has a higher chance of playing. The minimum value is 0. 
			If you are looping a sound, this value doesn't have any effect as looping sounds are always played.
			
			"loop" indicates that the sample should seamlessly loop.
			
			"pitchmin" and "pitchmax" indicate the min and max range to randomly pitch shift the sound.
			A value of 0 is the default pitch. The values must be integers.
