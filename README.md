A mod for Zuma's Revenge that aims to bring the Console experience to PC!

## What happened to zumas-revenge-rejuvenated (site) and ZumasRevengeRejuvenatedCheatTable?
Due to personal reasons I can no longer access these old repositories from that account. There may be forks soon.

## The beauty of the Console version comes to PC!
Enter the Tiki Island once again with a fresh coat of paint! Battle the mighty tiki bosses and guide your agile amphibian to victory!
With game assets extracted from the PS3 and XBLA versions, Tiki Island feels more lively than before.

## Features
- Assets extracted from the PS3 and XBLA versions; the levels look (almost) exactly like their Console counterparts
- Sounds from the PS3 and XBLA versions
- Effort

## Planned Features
- Gameplay that is similar or exactly like the Console version of the game; includes the point changes with no bugs and changed level files
  This was almost done, though due to some issues, it couldn't be done properly. **The cheat table used for this is not included in the mod; if you would like to help, please download it from the GitHub repository. Keep in mind that it searches for "ZumasRevenge.exe" and not "popcapgame1.exe" - just manually fix that.**

## Help Wanted!
- **An Assembly coder:** The person whom I used to work with is unfortunately busy with real life, and cannot further help in the mod's development. In addition EXE editing may be needed.
- **An Artist:** There are only 4 Spirit Animals in the Console version, and there are 7 Challenge trophies in the PC version. Unfortunately, I need an artist who can imitate the Console version artist's artstyle.

## Version Roadmap
- 0.8 (current) - current barebones version, with some unchanged vanilla graphics
- 0.9 - almost the same as 0.8, although with more graphical changes and the new Spirit Animal trophies
Closed Beta - gameplay change testing
- 1.0 - initial release
If you are interested in helping in any way, or if you encounter any problems, contact the developers on Discord: **Shambles#3117**, **Shambles#3117**.

## Known Issues
- Missing proper buttons on the main menu

## Installation
Assuming you own the game on Steam:

1. (Optional, but recommended): Backup your game files
2. Backup or rename main.pak
3. Extract the archive's contents
4. (Optional) Include the cheat table
5. Run the game. And if you haven't set it already, set it to Hi-Res mode.

**Hi-Res mode is REQUIRED for the mod to properly function; the mod was made with the Hi-Res mode in mind. If Hi-Res mode is not enabled, overlays/tunnels WILL look misplaced and the proper graphics will NOT show up. If you are unable to enable Hi-Res mode, watch this tutorial:**
